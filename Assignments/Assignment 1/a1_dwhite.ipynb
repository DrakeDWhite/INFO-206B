    "(3 points) Define a `City` class. Each `City` object will need instance variables to store the following information:\n",
    "- The city's country code (a two-letter string)\n",
    "- The city's name (a string)\n",
    "- The city's region (a two-character string)\n",
    "- The city's population (an int)\n",
    "- The city's latitude (a float)\n",
    "- The city's longitude (a float)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need five methods in the `City` class. The `__init__` method does the usual: it takes six parameters (plus self) and stores each in the appropriate instance variable. The `__str__` method returns a string consisting of the city's name, population, latitude, and longitude, separated by commas and with no spaces around the commas. For example, here's the string that `__str__` should return for a town in California (notice that the country code and region do not appear in this string):\n",

    "`Berkeley,100158,37.8716667,-122.2716667. `\n",
    "\n",
    "And then you will need three functions `getPopulation`, `getLatitude`, and `getName` that return the corresponding data values."
