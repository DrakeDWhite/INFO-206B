    "Implement a recursive binary search function, `binary_search`, which allows you to search a sorted list of items for a specific target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your recursive function should take four input parameters: `list` (a sorted list), `key` (the item being searched for), a `left_index` into the list, and a `right_index` into the list. Your function looks only in the sublist starting at the `left_index`, and ending at the `right_index` (including the item at the `right_index` position). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that the_list is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[27, 78, 105, 135, 411, 431, 434, 468, 493, 501, 525, 534, 551, 654, 780]`\n",

    " \n",
    "  If I call `binary_search(the_list, 500, 0, 14)`, the return value should be `None`, since the key `500` is not in `the_list`. The call `binary_search(the_list, 135, 2, 12)` should return 3 since, as before, the key `135` appears at index 3 in `the_list`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Notice that the index returned is the index in the entire list, not the relative index in the sublist starting at `left_index`. The parameters `left_index` and `right_index` just give the range of indices into the list that we are considering in a given call of `binary_search`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Here is what you need to do in your `binary_search` function:\n",

    "- If the sublist of `the_list` starting at `left_index` and ending at `right_index` is empty, then the key cannot be in the sublist -- return `None`.\n",

    "    - Compute the midpoint of this sublist, by taking the average of `left_index` and `right_index`, and rounding to the nearest integer as needed.\n",
    "    - If `key` is equal in value to the item at midpoint, then it has been found. Return this index.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, because `the_list` is sorted, you can tell whether `key`, if in `the_list`, is either in the sublist before `midpoint` or in the sublist after `midpoint`.\n",
    "    - If key is less than the item at midpoint and it's in the list, then it must be in the sublist before  `midpoint`. Recursively return the result of calling `binary_search` on the sublist starting at `left_index` and going up to and including the index just before `midpoint`.\n",
    "    - Only one other possibility remains: `key` is greater than the item at `midpoint`, and so if it's in the list, then it must be in the sublist after `midpoint`. Recursively return the result of calling `binary_search` on the sublist starting at the index just after `midpoint` and going up to and including `right_index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Once you have written your recursive binary search function, you should write a simple user interface as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt the user to specify the number of elements `(N)` in a list that you will create to be searched.\n",
    "- Generate a list of `N` random integers, with each integer in the range of 0 to 1000, then sort it. (You can use your very own `bubble_sort` function from Q1 above, or Python's built-in function sort() or sorted, to sort this list).\n",
    "- Print the list so that the user can see it.\n",
    "- Prompt the user for input from the keyboard. If the user enters \"?\", print the list. If the user enters \"q\", quit the search interface. Otherwise search the list for the element that the user entered.\n",
