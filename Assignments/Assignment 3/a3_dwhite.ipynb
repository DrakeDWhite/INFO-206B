    "Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing, text analysis, and other methods to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective information in many different contexts. In this assignment, you will perform a simple sentiment analysis on different texts, ranging from tweets to tomes. In the process, you will learn about the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of search algorithms and data structures."

    "You are given a [list of famous (or infamous) tweets](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~chuang/i206/b3/tweets.txt). from the colored history of Twitter. Your task is to compute the sentiment of each tweet based on the sentiment scores of the words in the tweet. For this part of the assignment, the sentiment of a tweet is simply the sum of the sentiment scores for each word in the tweet.\n",

    "You will use a hand-coded [sentiment lexicon developed by Finn Årup Nielsen](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn). that contains a list of ~2,400 English words with sentiment scores ranging from -5 (most negative) to 5 (most positive). Your program will read the file [AFINN-111.txt](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~chuang/i206/b3/AFINN-111.txt) into a dictionary data structure. (Note that the file is tab delimited, so you will want to use the `“\\t”` argument for your split method.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the ten tweets, you should split the tweet into its component words, removing any whitespaces and punctuations, and converting the words to lowercase. Then, you look up the sentiment score for each word in the dictionary. If a word is not found, its score is zero. The sentiment score of the tweet is the sum of the scores of the individual words. Print the tweet and its sentiment score."

Now, for each word in your tome, perform a linear search for the word in the first list. If and when the word is found, use the list index to look up the word's score in the second list. If you reach the end of the first list and cannot find the word, then the word's score is zero.
