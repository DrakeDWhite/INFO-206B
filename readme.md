# INFO-206B
## What is this repository?
This is the body of my work in Fall of 2022 at UC Berkeley in INFO-206B. This code is private, so if you're looking at it, you're probably someone I gave access to. Otherwise, please don't copy this code. That would be academically dishonest.

## Oh okay, so what's the course about? 
The full name of the course is "Introduction to Data Structures and Analytics", and it's taught by [Professor John Chuang](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/john-chuang) at University of California, Berkeley. This course is a class specifically offered as an introductory coding course for students in the School of Information's *Masters in Information Management and Systems* program, of which I am one :)

This course is taught in a reverse lecture format, meaning students watch virtual lectures ahead of meeting in person, and in-person lecture time is mainly comprised of coding challenges and questions. Virtual Lectures are provided by [Professor Hany Farid](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/hany-farid) and can be found in the Course Documentation -> LectureLinks.docx document. 

Students of this program are not expected to have prior programming experience. I have some history with programming in Python, but I'm a bit rusty as its been a few years since I used it in my undergrad, so here I am :)

 ## How can I read this code? It's in a weird format.
 This is pretty much all in Python, but it's done and arranged in a format native to [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install), so you won't be able to just crack it open in a Python IDE. Any file with the extension .ipnyb would need to be opened this way. 

 For instance, I did most of my coding in Visual Studio Code. Otherwise, you can just install Python and Jupyter to get access to it. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is probably the least painful way to install it if you're not familiar with Command Line installations. 

 Reach out if you have trouble.
